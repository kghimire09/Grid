# Grid
Create a Swing program that consists of a JFrame that holds one JPanel (which I will call the drawing panel). Divide the drawing panel into a grid (the size of which should be controlled by command line arguments and defaulting to 50 by 50) of cells. Paint each cell of the a random color. These colors should stay stable as the frame is resized, hidden, exposed, and otherwise manipulated. Draw thin grey lines between each cell of the grid. Note that the size of the cells will stay fixed, so rows and columns will have to be "added" or "removed" as the frame is resized. While there are ways to solve this problem with layout managers, this time just use your JPanel's paintComponent method to draw the requested pattern.
